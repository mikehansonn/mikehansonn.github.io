## Introduction

Language translation plays a crucial role in enhancing the user experience on myPlanet, which is used in diverse regions like Mexico, Nepal, Kenya, Ghana, and Somalia.

    -   If you find any untranslated sections, create an issue and resolve it. (Easy 2 points).

2.  **While reviewing PRs**:
    
    - You might encounter untranslated text when reviewing PRs.
    - Expand all the modified files.
    - Pay close attention to any text that remains in English and isn’t referenced from `@strings/...`

    - While working on different issues, you tend to explore the codebase more. This is when you might come across more untranslated texts.
    - Pay close attention to any text that remains in English and isn’t referenced from `@strings/...`
    - If you find it - easy 2 points!


## Leveraging ChatGPT to translate the texts

1.  **Prompt to train texts in the supported languages**:
    
    - Type in:
        ``` 
        Translate the following text in these languages:
            1. English
            2. Arabic
            3. Espanol
            4. francias
            5. nepali
            6. somalian 
        ```
    - Simply enter the text to be translated in double quotes (e.g., "mark all as read").
    - Watch the magic happen!

## Make the changes in codebase
	
1. **Add the translated texts to respective files**:
	- Copy and paste the translated text into the appropriate XML files.
	- For example, add `<string name="mark_all_as_read">Marcar todo como leído</string>` to `es/strings.xml`.
    - Replace the source text `"Mark all as read"` with `"@string/mark_all_as_read"`.
    - Repeat this process for the XML files of all supported languages.

2. **Build and test**:
	- Build the app.
    - Go to the screen where the changes should appear.
    - Switch between languages to verify that everything works as expected.

3. **Commit, Push, Create PR**:
	- Stage all changes.
    - Commit with an appropriate message.
    - Push to GitHub.
	- Create a pull request.
