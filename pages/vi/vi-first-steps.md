# First Steps – Software Engineering Virtual Intern

## The Big Picture

Welcome to the first steps for becoming an OLE Software Engineering Virtual Intern! We treat these first steps as a vetting process to prove that you can follow simple instructions before you can progress to working on harder projects in bigger teams. Consider them to be the interview for the internship.

If you are selected for the internship after completing the steps, you will be officially invited to join the OLE software engineering interns team! We’ll add you to relevant Discord channels and assign you to a specific team to work on developing and improving OLE’s software. Our current projects is **[Planet](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/planet) – a learning management system designed as a Progressive Web App using Angular and CouchDB.**

During this internship, you will have the opportunity to work with various software, tools, and technologies, including **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**, **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**, **[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)**, **[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)**, **[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)**, **[Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands)**, **[CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/)**, **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**, **[HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)**, **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)**, **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)**, **[Angular](https://angular.io/)**, **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**, **[SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)**, and **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**.

**NOTE**: This is an unpaid, intensive internship requiring at least 24 hours of work per week. You can find more information about the internship in our [FAQ](vi-faq.md#General_Internship_Questions). If you have additional questions, feel free to ask in the Discord server!

## The Steps

Social coding is a huge part of any open source and collaborative project, and the Open Learning Exchange (OLE) is no different. In the following series of steps, you will learn about Markdown, Vagrant, Docker, Git, GitHub, GitHub issues, GitHub pull requests, etc. You'll also be introduced to OLE's learning management system (LMS) – [Planet](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/planet).

**These steps may seem simple, but we expect high-quality work, which might require extra time. We want to see that you can use, or learn to use, these tools effectively — including writing clear GitHub issues, using basic Git commands, creating proper pull requests, navigating Planet, etc. Just passively following the steps is the bare minimum; instead, aim to impress us with excellent GitHub etiquette and well-structured Markdown.**

Take the opportunity to read more about the tools and languages we use to deepen your understanding and reduce confusion. **Treat these steps as learning opportunities!** The GitHub and Markdown skills you practice in first steps are crucial for both this internship and a future career in software development.

The MDwiki offers plenty of resources to help you complete these steps. You'll find a list of useful links at the end of each step. :)

**We also would like you to keep us regularly updated in the Discord channel as you complete these steps. We will ask you to send messages, links, and screenshots along the way, which we'll use to track your progress. Please make sure not to miss this, as it's crucial for us to track your work.**

A significant part of these steps is identifying problems or suggesting improvements for this MDwiki. As you complete the steps, take note of any issues you encounter or ideas for enhancements. This helps improve the MDwiki and these steps for future interns.

While there's no official deadline for completing these steps, most successful candidates finish them within 7-8 days. Good luck!

## Step 0 - Introductory Steps

There are 3 sub-steps in this step:

1. Send us your resume again along with a short description of yourself and what you would like to be called to [vi+resume@ole.org](mailto:vi+resume@ole.org).

2. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) then watch <a href="https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/open-learning-exchange.github.io" target="_blank">Open Learning Exchange's github.io repo</a> and Follow [dogi](https://github.com/dogi), [Laxman](https://github.com/lmmrssa), [Leonard](https://github.com/leomaxi), [Paul](https://github.com/paulbert), [Arpita](https://github.com/singharpita) and [Roshan](https://github.com/rrijal53) on GitHub. In GitHub, we "[Watch](https://help.github.com/en/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories)" organization repositories and ["Follow"](https://help.github.com/en/articles/following-people) individuals. Look for the "Watch" button at the top right of the page when you are in a repository.  Also, follow each other to see what others in the group are doing. (Click on the image to enlarge.)

3. We use Crowdin to translate our user interface into many different languages. If you know another language besides English, we would greatly appreciate if you would help translate. To do so, go to [this Crowdin link](https://crowdin.com/project/ole-planet/invite) to create a Crowdin account. A good goal is to get 10% of the words in your chosen language translated. If you have time, it would be even better to translate more of the words. After finishing [Step 4 - Planet Tutorial](vi-first-steps.md#Step_4_-_Planet_Tutorial), check out this [link](https://crowdin.com/page/tour#tab_translators) to learn how you can start contributing on Crowdin.

**NOTE**: See the [Planet User Manual](#!./pages/techgenius/tg-planet-user-manual.md) for an overview of functionality and an explanation of various terms. Your contributions will not only help us out but also give you a better understanding of what Planet does.

## Step 1 - Planet and Vagrant

There are 3 sub-steps in this step:

1. [Planet Installation with Vagrant](vi-planet-installation-vagrant.md)
  The **Planet** is a virtual library that is deployed internationally to individuals in countries that typically do not have access to educational resources. In this step, you will learn about how to set up your own Community Planet using vagrant.

2. [Planet Configurations](vi-configurations-vagrant.md)
  In this step, you will learn about how to configure your Community Planet.

3. [Vagrant Tutorial](vi-vagrant.md)
  **Vagrant** is an open-source software product for building and maintaining portable virtual software development environments. In this step, you will learn about how to interact with Vagrant through the command-line interface.

## Step 2 - Planet and Docker

Follow the instructions on the [Docker Tutorial page](vi-docker-tutorial.md). **Docker** is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization also known as containerization. In this step, you will learn the basics of interacting with Docker and Docker Compose through the command-line interface and basic commands for maintaining your Planet installation.

## Step 3 - Markdown and Fork Tutorial

Follow the instructions on the [GitHub and Markdown page](vi-github-and-markdown.md).

- Once you complete Step 3 you will have:
  - 1 Pull request made

Make sure that you've linked to your github.io and pull request link in [#vi-software channel on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1079980988421132369/1229437557843169280) (`https://YourUserName.github.io` and `LinkToYourPullRequest`). Also include the Raw.githack link in your pull request as we asked in the pull request template.

## Step 4 - Planet and myPlanet Tutorial

This step includes the [Planet Tutorial](vi-planetapps.md), which explains the features of the application.
And also there is [myPlanet Tutorial](vi-myplanet.md), which explains about Android application.

## Step 5 - Keeping Fork Updated

Follow the directions at [Git Repositories](vi-github-and-repositories.md) to keep your username.github.io and your local repository up to date.

## Step 6 - GitHub Issues Tutorial

Follow the tutorial under the [GitHub Issues tab](vi-github-issues.md) to create at least one issue. Post a link in [Discord](https://discord.gg/mtgGD4EnYW) whenever you create an issue or when you comment on someone else's issue. You are encouraged to post as many issues as you can for improving the page as well as for personal practice. No issue is too big or too small to be filed and **it is OK** if you are not sure how to fix it yourself. If you know how to solve an issue, be sure to provide a detailed account of your research and show how to fix it. It is ok to file an issue about minor typos and very small changes, but do not make this the case for all of the issues that you file. You can also work on issues that you didn't create.

Make sure you have created at least one issue, resolved it, commented on an issue you didn't create and have a pull request with the fix merged. You may continue making Issues, Pull requests and Comments, or move on to the next step, while you are waiting for your pull request to be merged. The approval process for your Step 6 fix may take time, but **it is OK** to continue working.

- Once you complete Step 6 you will have:
  - 2 pull requests made (one at step 3 and one at step 6)
  - 1 comment added (on an issue you didn't create)
  - 1 issue created

**Hint**: You can track your progress with the number of pull requests and issues [here](../track-first-steps-progress.md).

Please note that creating and working on Issues are not exactly bound by the "Step" you are in. Feel free to move on to other steps while you wait on OLE approval for your merge(s). You can also add more Issues and PR's in the meantime.

## Step 7 - Nation Planet

Follow the directions under the [Nation Planet tab](vi-nation.md).

## Step 8 - Create Issues and Pull Requests

In this step, your goal is to create, comment on, and resolve GitHub issues to improve our Markdown Wiki. Here's what you'll need to do:

1. **Create Issues**: Create 3 new issues in our GitHub repository regarding Software Engineering Intern First Steps. Each issue should be clear and focus on a specific problem or improvement. **Ensure that at least one issue addresses content reduction, such as dead links, repetitive content, excessive detail, or the potential to reference external official documentation.**

2. **Comment on Issues**: Provide helpful comments on at least 3 existing issues that you did not create. This could be to provide feedback, suggest solutions, ask questions, or clarify the issue.

3. **Resolve Issues with Pull Requests**: Resolve the 3 issues by making the necessary changes in separate branches derived from `master` in your repository, and submit a distinct pull request for each one.

Follow the **same process** as described in the [GitHub Issues Tutorial step](vi-github-issues.md), working to improve our documentation for future interns. To get your pull requests merged, they must be approved by at least two other OLE team members/interns. After creating a pull request, announce it on the Discord chat to request reviews. You may need to make additional corrections based on feedback.

Remember, even small issues are worth addressing. Keep your issues focused and concise. If your pull requests need additional approvals, continue to work on other tasks while you wait.

Just as your learning with this Wiki was made possible by the efforts of previous interns, now we turn to you to continue that tradition and help future interns take their First Steps. Help us make this documentation clear and useful for those who follow.

**NOTE**: While adding details can be helpful, it's important to remember that less is often more. Over time, this First Steps guide has become bloated with too much information, making it harder to follow. As you work on improving this guide, focus on simplifying the instructions and removing any unnecessary content. The goal is to create a clear and concise guide that future virtual interns can easily understand and use.

**NOTE**: While waiting for two OLE team members to approve your Pull Requests, you can continue creating more Issues and Pull Requests (upon approval, we suggest). They will all count towards your final Issue/PR total. PR approval can take time, so don't let a lengthy approval/fix process stop you from progressing in your "First Steps".

Once you complete Step 8 you will have:

- 5 merged pull requests (one at step 3, one at step 6 and three at step 8)
- 4 comments made on issues you didn't create (one at step 6 and three at step 8)
- 4 issues created (one at step 6 and three at step 8)

**Hint**: You can track your progress with the number of pull requests and issues [here](../track-first-steps-progress.md).

## Step 9 - Be part of the team

Once you have finished step 8, sync your community with the nation (as you did in Step 7 - [Nation Planet tab](vi-nation.md)).

Next thing is to add yourself to the virtual intern list found in [vi-team.md](vi-team.md) and create a pull request. Message us ("@mutugiii", "@dogi" and "@vi-software") in our Discord #vi-software channel so that we can set up a meeting and add you to the team as soon as possible.

Make sure to read through the [software engineering intern orientation document](vi-intern-orientation.md) before the meeting.
